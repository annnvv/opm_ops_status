# OPM Operating Status

I decided to scrape the OPM federal government operating status archive page to get the operating status between January 15, 1998 and March 23, 2018 (website found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/status-archives/). Then, I got Ronald Reagan National Airport snow totals from NOAA (data can be obtained here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search). I combined the two datasets and plotted the snow fall totals by date and federal government operating status.
